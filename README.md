# GetBooxUpxKeys

This project is related to and written for [decryptBooxUpdateUpx](https://github.com/Hagb/decryptBooxUpdateUpx).

Run on your Boox device with Boox OS above Android 10, and the application will automatically get the key strings from `libota_jni.so`.

Then you can click the button "COPY TO CLIPBOARD" to copy the strings to clipboard.

## TODO

- Get key strings from a `libota_jni.so` on other path.
- Get key strings from legacy Boox `OnyxOtaService.apk`.
